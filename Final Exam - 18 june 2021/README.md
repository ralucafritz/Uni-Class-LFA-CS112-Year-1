- [x] Exercise 1 (25p). Imagine a Turing Machine that has two heads and one tape. You need to:
  1. Give formal definition of this type of TM.
  2. Give a clear explanation of computation for this type of TM. Include a formal description of computation.
- [x] Exercise 2 (20p). Implement a library/program in a programming language of your choosing to load and validate a configuration file of a TM with two heads and one tape. Also implement a simulator for this type of TM.
- [x] Exercise 3 (25p). Create a configuration file for a two head, one tape TM that recognize the language L = {w#w’|where w’ is a prefix of w}. 
- [x] Exercise 4 (30p). Create a configuration file of a (normal) or two-head, one tape TM that performs addition of two natural numbers.
